# guess
This a python mini project in which the user has to guess the number, which will be a random number imported to the code using random module.
This Python script implements a simple number guessing game. The program generates a random number between 0 and a user-specified value (inclusive) 
and asks the user to guess the number. It provides feedback on each guess, indicating whether the guess is correct or not and whether the user's guess 
is above or below the randomly generated number.

Usage
1)Run the script in a Python environment.
2)The program will prompt you to enter a number. Please ensure you enter a positive integer greater than 0.
3)If you provide a valid input, the program will generate a random number between 0 and the specified value (inclusive).
4)The game will ask you to make a guess. Enter a number as your guess.
5)The program will provide feedback based on your guess:
  *If your guess is correct, it will display "You got it" and end the game.
  *If your guess is incorrect, it will display "You got it wrong!" and inform you whether your guess was above or below the random number.
6)The game continues until you guess the correct number. The program will display the number of guesses you made before finding the correct answer.
